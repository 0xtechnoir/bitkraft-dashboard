## Notes on Prisma

Prisma is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to streamline interaction with data in this application
https://www.prisma.io/docs/

It contains a schema which can be found:
prisma -> schema.prisma

When any changes are made to the database you will need to run:
```
yarn prisma db pull
```
This will update the schema in the project. Then run:
```
yarn prisma generate
```
This will ensure the prisma client is updated with any schema changes.
